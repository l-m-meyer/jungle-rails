<h1 class="mt-3 mb-4">About Us</h1>
<h4 class="mb-4 text-center">We LOVE plants! ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´</h4>
<p>
  Plants produce clean air and a clear mind (ever heard of <em>biophilia</em>?) and this is why we at Jungle have developed the ideal store for everyone to be a plant parent and better their life. Black thumb? No problem! Snag one of our many resilient plants. Forgetful? Well...set a reminder. Your plants need water and so do you. Take care of a plant and inadventerly take care of yourself. You got this!

  Jungle was founded to serve our community by providing plants to people from all walks of life. Need to jazz up your WFH space? Get a little plant. Feeling lonely from not seeing another person for two years, get a nice indoor tree and BAM! You have a new friend.
